## Sprint Retrospective Questions

1. What went well during the sprint?
2. What could be improved?
3. What impediments were encountered?
4. What will we commit to improve in the next sprint?

## Risk Mitigation

**High Risk Items**:
- Interface design complexity - Mitigate with early prototyping
- Go concurrency patterns - Address with focused learning sessions

**Medium Risk Items**:
- Testing strategy complexity - Start simple and iterate
- CI/CD setup challenges - Use existing templates and examples
