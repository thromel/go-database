# Go Database Engine Sprint Planning

## Project Overview

This sprint planning structure organizes the development of a custom database engine in Go, designed to serve as both an educational platform and a production-ready embedded database solution.

## Key Design Goals

- **ACID Compliance**: Full transactional guarantees with configurable isolation levels
- **Performance**: Optimized for modern hardware (NVMe SSDs, multi-core CPUs)
- **Simplicity**: Easy to embed and use, similar to SQLite but native to Go
- **Innovation**: Incorporating cutting-edge features like adaptive indexing and time-travel queries
- **Extensibility**: Modular design allowing easy addition of new storage engines and features

## Sprint Structure

### Phase 1: Foundation (Sprints 1-3)
- **Sprint 1**: Core Infrastructure & Basic Storage
- **Sprint 2**: Storage Engine & Indexing
- **Sprint 3**: Persistence & WAL

### Phase 2: Transactional Layer (Sprints 4-6)
- **Sprint 4**: Transaction Management
- **Sprint 5**: Concurrency Control
- **Sprint 6**: Recovery System

### Phase 3: Query Processing (Sprints 7-9)
- **Sprint 7**: Query Parser & Analyzer
- **Sprint 8**: Query Optimizer
- **Sprint 9**: Query Executor

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (Sprints 10-12)
- **Sprint 10**: MVCC & Time-Travel Queries
- **Sprint 11**: Adaptive Indexing
- **Sprint 12**: ML-Enhanced Optimization

### Phase 5: Production Ready (Sprints 13-15)
- **Sprint 13**: Performance Optimization
- **Sprint 14**: Monitoring & Observability
- **Sprint 15**: Security & Deployment

## Story Types

- **Epic**: Large features spanning multiple sprints
