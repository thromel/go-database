## Concurrency Test Scenarios

1. **Reader-Writer Conflicts**: Multiple readers with occasional writers
2. **Write-Write Conflicts**: Competing writers on same resources
3. **Deadlock Scenarios**: Circular dependency creation and resolution
4. **High Contention**: Many transactions competing for few resources
5. **Mixed Workloads**: Combination of read-heavy and write-heavy transactions
6. **Long Transactions**: Impact of long-running transactions on concurrency
7. **Isolation Violations**: Prevention of dirty reads, phantom reads, etc.

## Isolation Level Test Matrix

| Isolation Level | Dirty Read | Non-Repeatable Read | Phantom Read |
|----------------|------------|-------------------|--------------|
| Read Uncommitted | Allowed | Allowed | Allowed |
| Read Committed | Prevented | Allowed | Allowed |
